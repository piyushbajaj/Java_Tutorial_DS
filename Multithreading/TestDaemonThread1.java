 * Daesom thread in java is a service provider, that provides service to the user thread.
 * Its life depend on the mercy of user thread, i.e., when all the user thread dies, JVM terminates this thread automatically.
 * There are many Daemon threads which runs automatically, like gc, finalizer, etc.
 * It provides services to user threads for background supporting tasks. It has no role in life than to serve user threads.
 * Its life depends on user threads.
 * It is a low priority thread.
 Q. Why JVM terminates the daemon thread if there is no user thread?

 Ans. The sole purpose of the daemon thread is that it provides services to user thread for background supporting task.
 If there is no user thread, why should JVM keep running this thread.
 That is why JVM terminates the daemon thread if there is no user thread.

 #The java.lang.Thread class provides two methods for java daemon thread.

 public void setDaemon(boolean status): It is used to mark the current thread as daemon thread or user thread.
 public boolean isDaemon(): It is used to check that current is daemon.
